## First Order of the Day: Sleepy Corner
Good Morning Friends, how are you doing, I've been thinking.
Mainly about Modding but that aside, i thought about adding a small thing called Sleepy Corner, which will be a part of the Blog where i talk about the Stuff that i think about while in Bed trying to sleep, which frankly, happens quite often.
So, here's the First **Sleepy Corner** (Might need to think of a new Name):
> I've been thinking about Minecraft Modding, especially for Version b1.7.3 which i find pretty Interesting.
> I kinda want to make a Tech-mod for that Version, that is a bit inspired by GregTech and the GT:NH Pack.
> But instead of the Amp Based Energy System id go with a more RF like system.
> Since i love Multiblocks, that would be my challenge to add those, like a big crusher, with animated textures.
> I think it would work best as a Standalone Mod though because it would change a lot of the Base Recipes, like Iron which
> would now need to be processed super realistically.
>> Maybe i'll make that one day, after all, i specifically made this so i don't forget

## Changes to the Blog 
Chances are, that i'll start working on the **new Blog Interface** later Today, which will include the **Comment System** i talked about in the [last Post](https://openblocki.github.io/2025/mk-and-site-upgrade.html).
Since i've also been around other Corners of the Internet, i might also add a Page to show stuff from my Half Dead Twitch channel, which i rarely stream on. (Mainly in German though). And maybe even, if i find a way, to show of stuff from my pretty dead **PlanetMinecraft** account.
To Summarize the Planned Blog changes:
> - Completely new Inteface
> - Pages to show off Stuff from my Half Dead Twitch Channel and my Pretty much Dead PlanetMinecraft Channel
> - A Page to show Progress on Development of Stuff for the Blog of for the Dev Journey (Did not talk about this)
> - A Page for some show and tell off Games i Play (Mainly GT:NH and other Minecraft Stuff, Vanilla and Modded) (Did not talk about this)
> - A Page to show the Suggestions Issue (Did not talk about this)
