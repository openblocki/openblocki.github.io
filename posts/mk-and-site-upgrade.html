    <h2 id="first-order-of-the-day-learning-about-markdown">First Order of the Day: Learning about Markdown</h2>
<p>So, since i’ve started this Blog i checked out Markdown and how it works / how to use it using <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Official Documentation</a>, just so i can do this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cool Block and Stuff</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is also a thing</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>This will probably come in handy, since i want to show my path of learning Game Dev here and it might help with Visualisation and things.
Especially</p>

<h2 id="why-blog">Why Blog</h2>
<p>None of you might ask, why make a Blog. 
Well, i felt like this is the best way to make a public Portfolio, while also having a somewhat creative outlet.
Of course this isnt supposed to stay only a Blog forever, I plan on Making a proper Site out of this like <a href="https://www.paulscode.com/">Paulscode</a>, specifically before the new Forum, for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230321172757/http://www.paulscode.com/">this one</a> on the Wayback Machine. While i do like having a Forum for stuff and things, since i currently am limited to Github pages, there is no way i’ll be doing that until i have the spare money to pay for a paid Host.</p>

<h2 id="comment-system-without-a-db">Comment System without a DB</h2>
<p>So, since i don’t want this a completely One-Sided, i thought about how i could impelement a Comment System, i first thought about GitHub Issues which allow there to be Different Topics and for basically everyone to add their own comment, while also being E-Mail verfied. And i mean, i don’t have to do any Security stuff like EMail login / Password Storage, which would be disaster. So i’m currently trying to find a way to assign GitHub Issues to different Posts and then showing their Comments at the Bottom of the according Post.</p>

<h2 id="blog-rework">Blog Rework</h2>
<p>With all the Stuff already written above, you might already know that i plan on reworking this Blog, mainly because i dont like how Jekyll looks and works, while yes, it’s very usefull and easy, it’s just not for me, i like the more old-school look of Plain CSS and HTML. And it would also help with the GitHub Issue Comments implementation because i have more controll over the self-written stuff. And it makes Improving the HomePage a lot easier in my opinion + Migrating to another host.</p>

<h2 id="plans-for-the-blog-and-game-dev">Plans for the Blog and Game-Dev</h2>
<p>This Blog was mainly Created to Document my Journey of becoming a Game Developer.
The only problem being: I’m lazy, very lazy.
I love to Procrastinate and that with a passion.
Maybe this Blog helps me get off my lazy ass and Start up Godot or something.</p>
