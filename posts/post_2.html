<meta name="description" content="First Order of the Day: Sleepy Corner Good Morning Friends, how are you doing, I’ve been thinking. Mainly about Modding but that aside, i thought about adding a small thing called Sleepy Corner, which will be a part of the Blog where i talk about the Stuff that i think about while in Bed trying to sleep, which frankly, happens quite often. So, here’s the First Sleepy Corner (Might need to think of a new Name): I’ve been thinking about Minecraft Modding, especially for Version b1.7.3 which i find pretty Interesting. I kinda want to make a Tech-mod for that Version, that is a bit inspired by GregTech and the GT:NH Pack. But instead of the Amp Based Energy System id go with a more RF like system. Since i love Multiblocks, that would be my challenge to add those, like a big crusher, with animated textures. I think it would work best as a Standalone Mod though because it would change a lot of the Base Recipes, like Iron which would now need to be processed super realistically. Maybe i’ll make that one day, after all, i specifically made this so i don’t forget" />

<p>Good Morning Friends, how are you doing, I’ve been thinking.
Mainly about Modding but that aside, i thought about adding a small thing called Sleepy Corner, which will be a part of the Blog where i talk about the Stuff that i think about while in Bed trying to sleep, which frankly, happens quite often.
So, here’s the First <strong>Sleepy Corner</strong> (Might need to think of a new Name):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been thinking about Minecraft Modding, especially for Version b1.7.3 which i find pretty Interesting.
I kinda want to make a Tech-mod for that Version, that is a bit inspired by GregTech and the GT:NH Pack.
But instead of the Amp Based Energy System id go with a more RF like system.
Since i love Multiblocks, that would be my challenge to add those, like a big crusher, with animated textures.
I think it would work best as a Standalone Mod though because it would change a lot of the Base Recipes, like Iron which
would now need to be processed super realistically.</p>

    <p>Maybe i’ll make that one day, after all, i specifically made this so i don’t forget</p>

<h2 id="changes-to-the-blog">Changes to the Blog</h2>
<p>Chances are, that i’ll start working on the <strong>new Blog Interface</strong> later Today, which will include the <strong>Comment System</strong> i talked about in the <a href="https://openblocki.github.io/2025/mk-and-site-upgrade.html">last Post</a>.
Since i’ve also been around other Corners of the Internet, i might also add a Page to show stuff from my Half Dead Twitch channel, which i rarely stream on. (Mainly in German though). And maybe even, if i find a way, to show of stuff from my pretty dead <strong>PlanetMinecraft</strong> account.
To Summarize the Planned Blog changes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Completely new Inteface</li>
    <li>Pages to show off Stuff from my Half Dead Twitch Channel and my Pretty much Dead PlanetMinecraft Channel</li>
    <li>A Page to show Progress on Development of Stuff for the Blog of for the Dev Journey (Did not talk about this)</li>
    <li>A Page for some show and tell off Games i Play (Mainly GT:NH and other Minecraft Stuff, Vanilla and Modded) (Did not talk about this)</li>
    <li>A Page to show the Suggestions Issue (Did not talk about this)</li>
  </ul>
